This is a script for the game Space Engineers. It is to be used with a custom made chessboard that uses a set of projectors for displaying the game.
The chessboard additionally comes with a set of buttons that allow for performing chess moves as well as LCD's and their coresponding buttons that allow the users to change settings and perform mid-game operations.
This script is capable of:
Performing chess moves made by the users only when they follow the general rules of chess,
Auto-detecting wins and draws of all types,
Mid-game player communication (draw offers, resignations, extending time),
Customization (chess clocks, different in-game sounds, rotating pieces, animation speeds and types, event times),
Serialization (saving) of data during and after the chess game has been finished upon exiting the game,
CRUD operations of chess games except 'update' - You can save, delete, review and analyse saved games.
